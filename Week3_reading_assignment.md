# Week 3: Reading Assignment

> Geoff Boeing’s work on street grids is an exciting contribution. When I read Off the grid and back again? and saw the video with the planning students, I think that analyzing street grids will be crucial as people advocate to reimagine what communities and cities will be designed. I would be interested in knowing Boeing’s thoughts on bike lane designs and future public transportation lines. I would agree with the more disconnected design from 1940-the 1990s; Los Angeles has a dispersed design made for a car-centric city, making it challenging to navigate carless. But what policy changes or community-engaged solutions can be created to make streets more walkable and livable? I find it challenging to reconstruct literal roads, but programs like vision zero, slow streets, and ciclavia, are examples of taking over physical space and repurposing streets. Finally, I would agree with Boeing’s last point in the video about data science as a future prerequisite for planners. Data is so crucial for a lot of the work planners do and analyze in any sector they go into. I didn’t know what to expect from UP206A and assumed we would be working with Esri products, but I appreciate the design of this class. Although coding terrifies me, I understand the importance of learning how to analyze data through this method. It provides more freedom of products that require expensive licenses. It allows for an added level of analyzing information and creating outputs through code lines.
