# The PNAS street-network sprawl paper 

> In Adam Millard-Ball, the Street -network disconnectedness index (SNDi) to determine the countries and cities that have over time developed more connective grids and saw a decline in their grid system. Millard-Ball examines MSA growing early on in the 50-the 70s and where they are now and developing countries that had less developing in the 50s/70s. The article examines that Large cities in the United States see a decline in their grid's connective. In contrast, global south towns in India and China see an increase in their cities' grid system. I think that the outcomes of the report make sense. In Los Angeles, we saw automobile lobbyists lobbying for more car infrastructure development and this, in turn, saw less walking and public transportation infrastructure. Moving forward, as we think about planning and revitalizing cities, how can we build upon the current grid. My biggest concern with supporting an increase in more bike, public transportation systems that we can see spaces, significantly housing harmed to make projects possible. 

> In Latin America, the city grids reflect their colonizers home city development. How have these grids in Latin American countries impacted or supported income disparity among residents? My family is from El Salvador and the gated community developments are all too real. They donâ€™t support housing developments and intensifying informal housing settlements for the poor. Is there a way to track informal housing developments along the city grid systems previously developed and how have settlements improved/deteriorated connectedness of cities?
