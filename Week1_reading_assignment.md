The article looks at different cities and shares examples of how cities have changed how they build a budget by being more intentional about including race equity in the process. The article emphasizes using data on communities to help elected officials better understand where people are experiencing hardships. The article outlines seven ways governments can include a racial lens when building a budget. 1. A clear city or county definition of equity. 2. Use data to demonstrate the inequities. 3. Use data to hold elected officials accountable. 4. Assessment of equity through reports and tracking. 5. Include the voices of diverse communities. 6. Perform high-level view of fund allocations for more significant equity. 7. Find ways to simplify budget disbursements. Elected officials need to understand why a racial equity lens is necessary, especially during a pandemic. Cities in the article have seen the ground improvement in people's lives through the new way's government prioritizes areas such as housing or providing direct cash assistance to their residents. 

I chose this article because it provides ways to incorporate an equity lens when prioritizing the budget, especially during the current pandemic. As we see our economy and people severely impacted by job loss/reduction, governments will need to rethink how they build a budget that isn't based on austere measures but relies more on improving people's lives. The ways explained in the article can help local government think about funding distribution when it comes to the most vulnerable and most impacted by COVID-19 by looking at the data in localized areas and not broadly. Where are the regions experiencing a lack of jobs, unemployment, etc., and how can governments localized their support through the budget process. This article helps inform my own data science goals because I am interested in looking at poverty and wages in Black and Latino neighborhoods in Los Angeles.
